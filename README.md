# ðŸŒ€ Visualization of Mandelbrot's Fractal
This Python script visualizes the Mandelbrot Set, a famous fractal that exhibits complex and beautiful patterns from simple mathematical rules. The script:

- Computes the Mandelbrot set over a grid of complex numbers.

- Iterates each point up to a specified maximum to determine whether it belongs to the set.

- Uses NumPy for efficient computation and Matplotlib to render the fractal image.

- Displays the result using a heatmap-style colormap to indicate how quickly points diverge.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy and matplotlib.

```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```



# ðŸ“ˆ Features:

- Adjustable resolution, bounds, and iteration depth.

- Heatmap visualization with iteration-based coloring.

- ðŸ–¼ Output: A 2D colored visualization of the Mandelbrot set in the complex plane.
